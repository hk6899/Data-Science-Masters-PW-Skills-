    "Multithreading in Python streamlines the efficient utilization of resources as the threads share the same memory and data space. It also allows the concurrent appearance of multiple tasks and reduces the response time. This improves the performance. Python virtual machine is not a thread-safe interpreter, meaning that the interpreter can execute only one thread at any given moment. This limitation is enforced by the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which essentially limits one Python thread to run at a time"
