    "Infrastructure Ownership:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: In traditional hosting, a website or application is hosted on a physical server or a dedicated server that is owned or leased by the hosting provider or the client. The client has full control over the server's resources.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting relies on a network of virtual servers that are hosted on a distributed infrastructure managed by a cloud service provider. Clients use virtualized resources, and the underlying physical hardware is shared among multiple users.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Scaling resources in traditional hosting typically involves upgrading to a more powerful physical server. It may require downtime and manual intervention.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting offers scalable resources on-demand. Clients can easily increase or decrease their resources (compute power, storage, etc.) in real-time based on their needs without significant downtime.\n",
    "Cost Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Typically involves fixed monthly or yearly costs, even if the client doesn't fully utilize the allocated resources. Additional costs may be incurred for server upgrades or maintenance.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Adopts a pay-as-you-go model, where clients are billed based on their actual resource usage. This can be cost-effective, especially for applications with varying workloads.\n",
    "Redundancy and Reliability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Relies on a single physical server or a few servers. If there is a hardware failure, it may result in downtime unless there is a backup system in place.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Utilizes redundancy across multiple servers and data centers. If one server fails, traffic is automatically routed to other available servers, improving reliability and minimizing downtime.\n",
    "Management and Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Clients have more control over the configuration and management of their servers. They are responsible for tasks like software updates, security, and maintenance.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Cloud providers handle much of the infrastructure management, including updates, security, and maintenance. Clients have control over their applications and data but rely on the cloud provider for underlying infrastructure management.\n",
    "Global Availability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Hosting: Limited to the physical location of the hosting provider's data center. Expansion to multiple geographical locations may require additional infrastructure setup.\n",
    "Cloud Hosting: Offers global availability, allowing clients to deploy their applications and services in various regions around the world, improving latency and user experience for geographically dispersed audiences."
